TripleTen Sprint 4 Project -Saving Superstore  Project

This is the 4rd project I worked on in the TripleTen BIA program.

Description: The project task was to review the Superstoreâ€™s operations and increase its profitability to avoid bankruptcy.The dataset of Superstore was provided by TripleTen.Data was downloaded I first explored the dataset ,cleaned by importing in tableau by using calculated field 

Objectives:

1.To identify the important centers of profit and loss for the superstore.

2.To identify the 3 best combinations of states and month of the year to advertise in and budget for each.

3.Which products have the highest return rate and which customers have the highest return rate?

Conclusion and Analysis:Part 1:
 Profits/Losses
 Based on the analysis
 1. Two pairs of dimensions are Subcategory + Region
 Two profit centers are Copiers(West) and Chairs(East) Region.
 Two loss centers are Binders(Central) and Tables(East) Region.
 2. The Superstore should stop selling the products with lowest(most negative) profits on the top.
 3. Three subcategories which store should focus are Copiers ,Phones and Accessories.
 Three subcategories that store should stop selling are Tables, Bookcases and Supplies
 Part 2:
 Advertising
 Based on the analysis
 The top three states with highest average profits are
 Washington in March: 521.3
 Indiana in November: 643.1
 Vermont in November: 596.0
 Apply the 1/5 Rule:
 Calculate 1/5 of each month's profit for the advertising budget.
 Calculations:
 Washington March: [ \text{Ad Budget} = \frac{521.3}{5} = 104.26 ]
 Indiana November: [ \text{Ad Budget} = \frac{643.1}{5} = 128.62 ]
 Vermont November: [ \text{Ad Budget} = \frac{596.0}{5} = 119.20 ]
 Part 3:
 Returned Items:
 Based on the analysis
 The products on the top of bar chart have highest return rates
 The customers on the top of bar chart have highest return rates
 Analysis:
 The Superstore should go away from states with negative profits and the highest return rates.
 whereas the superstore should keep doing business from states with positive profits and the
 least return rates
