TripleTen Sprint 4 Project -Saving Superstore  Project

This was the 4rd project I worked on in the TripleTen BIA program.

ðŸ”—Description: The project task was to review the Superstoreâ€™s operations and increase its profitability to avoid bankruptcy.The dataset of Superstore was provided by TripleTen.Data was downloaded I first explored the dataset ,cleaned by importing in tableau by using calculated field 

ðŸ”—Objectives:

1.To identify the important centers of profit and loss for the superstore any two pairs of dimensions.

2.To identify the 3 best combinations of states and month of the year to advertise in and budget for each.

3.Which products have the highest return rate and which customers have the highest return rate?

ðŸ”—Conclusion and Analysis:

 Profits/Losses  Among pairs of dimensions (subcategory + region)

1. Two profit centers are Copiers(West) and Chairs(East) Region.
 
  Two loss centers are Binders(Central) and Tables(East) Region.
 
2. The  top three states with highest average profits are
 
 Washington in March: 521.3
 
 Indiana in November: 643.1
 
 Vermont in November: 596.0
 
 Apply the 1/5 Rule:
 Calculate 1/5 of each month's profit for the advertising budget.
 
 Calculations:
 
 Washington March: [ \text{Ad Budget} = \frac{521.3}{5} = 104.26 ]
 
 Indiana November: [ \text{Ad Budget} = \frac{643.1}{5} = 128.62 ]
 
 Vermont November: [ \text{Ad Budget} = \frac{596.0}{5} = 119.20 ]
 
3.The products on the top of bar chart have highest return rates and the customers on the top of bar chart have highest return rates for more reference the following screenshots<img width="908" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/210c14db-4b9b-4311-b764-1495ea74e043">

Ideas for further improvement: The Superstore should go away from states with negative profits and the highest return rates
 whereas the superstore should keep doing business from states with positive profits and the least return rates.
