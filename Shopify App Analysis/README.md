TripleTen Sprint 6 Project -Shopify App Analysis Project

This was the 6th project I worked on in the TripleTen BIA program.

Description: The project task was to review the landscape of apps on the Shopify platform, using data scraped from publicly available Shopify websites and to figure out what key factors play into the success of a Shopify app.

Objectives:
1.Make a KPI Card (a visual with a single number) that counts the unique number of apps and add it to your App Landscape sheet.

2.Make a Line Chart getting the sum of the review count on the Y-axis, and the lastmod date on the X-Axis.

3.Make a Scatterplot with the reviews_count on the X axis and the average rating on the Y axis

4.Make a Card with the average value of the new helpful_reviews column.

5.Make a scatterplot comparing the average rating on the Y-Axis by the value of the developer_answered column on the X-Axis.

6.Make the relationship many-to-one built as many (Reviews table) to one (Apps table). Using this new table, make a bar chart with the developer on the X-Axis, and the sum of rating on the Y-Axis.

7.Make a new bar chart with developer on the X-Axis against the helpful_review average on the Y-Axis.

8.Make a bar chart with the developer from the apps table and the developer_answered column to find out the most responsive developer. Add a Filter for this visual only which selects only the rows where reviews_count is greater than 500.
