 ðŸ”— Description: To analyse the Manhattan vacation rental market to help the client on which property types to invest in for which NYC Airbnb Data was provided by TripleTen.Data was downloaded I first explored the dataset ,cleaned it and analyse it by using advanced functions ,visualizations,and pivot table.


 ðŸ”— Objectives: To make recommendations by answering the following questions:
      1. Which neighborhoods and property sizes (i.e. number of bedrooms) are most attractive for vacation rentals?
      2. How much money did these listings generate?

 ðŸ”— Conclusion with Results:
      1. Three most attractive neighborhoods were Harlem ,Lower East Side ,Hells  Kitchen
      2. The 3 most popular property sizes (number of bedrooms)were Studios(441 listings), 1-bedrooms(1265 listings)
      and 2-bedroom(526 listings)
      3. The  number of bedrooms  the most popular in Harlem was found to be 1
