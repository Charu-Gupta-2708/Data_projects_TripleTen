TripleTen Sprint 5 Project -Story Telling Superstore Project

This was the 5th project I worked on in the TripleTen BIA program.

Description:To understand what is causing customers to return their orders and how to reduce the volume of returned orders.The dataset of Superstore was provided by TripleTen.Data was downloaded and cleaned by importing in tableau using calculated field  and orders and returned  tables were joined using the left join.

Objectives: To find out the root causes of returned orders the following worksheets were made
1.A scatterplot showing the correlation between total sales and total returns to find if sales always correlate positively with returns?

2.A bar chart showing the return rate by product category.

3.The return rate by customer. To find customers who are more prone to making returns, add a filter to remove customers with only 1 order.

4.A map showing the return rate by some geographic measure (state, city, etc.) to see if there is a geographic concentration to returned orders

5.The return rate by some measure of time (month, week, etc.) to see if there is a seasonal effect to returned orders

6.Two different kinds of composite charts showing the return rate for a mix of multiple factors (date/geography/product category/etc.)

Conclusion with Results:A dashboard was created by using all worksheets and a tableau story was  created using all worksheets as a base for story
